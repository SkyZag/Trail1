1. i have got a lead for the maps that is by using geolocation API directly in the html code
2. my old program has been refined to get one file and return the trash classification of the detected object

1. i have found that we can use the open source version of gpt4-mini instead of gemini api which will help us imporve in our time taken for result,
2. also i have prepared a porgram that will use the model and processor from our system and use GPU acceleration,
3. and also i hope this model can be finetuned to just give the classification of trash with faster responce and better accuracy
